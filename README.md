# Scrabble
In this project, you will process some data from a group of friends playing scrabble. Dictionaries will be used to organize players, words, and points. There are many ways you can extend this project on your own.

The real game takes place in 'scrabble.py' file. You can modify 'test.py' to append more players and words.

This game has been made for the purpose of adding some words ramdomly associated to each player and comparing the results. The winner is the one who gets the most points.
